This is a first app that I made with React. I made this app when I was working on [Udacity React Nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

### What I worked on
- Fetch book data from the API and list cards with thumbnail title, author and description based on a user reading status.
- Link to google book review page, when users click the book card.
- Users can update bookshelf from the main page, or remove from any bookshelves.
- Allow users to search books and add them to bookshelf from the search page.
