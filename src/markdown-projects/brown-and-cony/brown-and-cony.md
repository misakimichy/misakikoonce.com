Please hover over the Brown face then hover over the right area of him! (Brown is the name of the brown bear.)


This is the very first project in my coding life! After I learnt HTML and CSS online, I decided to create a cute project to practice the knowledge.
Those characters are Brown and Cony from [LINE](https://line.me/en/), and they are a cute coupleðŸ˜»

# How to create Brown
Did you see that Brown inclines his head and also a speech bubble? Isn't this cute?

I used `<div>`s for all of the parts besides eyes then styled with CSS. His eyes are created with an unordered list with two empty list items. Use `border-radius` to make content round, apply color with `background-color`. For the code sustainability, save the colors in `:root`. `:root` comes the the very beginning of the `.css`:
```
:root {
    --maincolor: #6f4343;
    --conycolor: #fffff8;
    --conyoutline: #645e5e;
}
```

In this project, I have three colors saved in `:root`. When you want to change the color, all you need to do is just updating the color in `:root` instead of checking and changing all colors in the codeÂ ðŸ™Œ

You can also set sizes in `:root`, for example, set your `<h1>` - `<h5>` font-size or `margin` size and use it repeatedly in the project.


## How to apply :root value in CSS
You can apply the value to the element using the keyword `var`:
```
.face {
    background-color: var(--maincolor);
}
```
Now the `.face` background-color is `--maincolor`, which is `#6f4343!` You can just swap the color name (`background-color: #6f4343`) with `background-color: var(value-name)`ðŸ¥³


## How to create a speech bubble
I used a `<div>` and pseudo selectors, `:before` and `:after` to create this speech bubble. 


# How to create Cony
The techniques are really similar to Brown. I just created different shapes in different sizes.

## How to create a heart?
To create a heart, I combined one square and two circles.

1. Create a square then tilt it 45 degrees.

2. Then use `:before` and `:after` pseudo selector and create two circles. Since those elements have width of the square, I set width and height 100%.

3. Place one circle to the top left of the square perimeter which becomes the circle's diameter, and another circle to the top right.

Tad-dah - It's a heart nowðŸ§¡
