This is the very first project in my coding life! After I learnt HTML and CSS online, I decided to create a cute project to practice them.
Those characters are Brown and Cony from [LINE](https://line.me/en/), which is my favorite messaging app. They are boyfriend and girlfriend.

## How to create Brown
Please hover over the Brown face then hover over the right area of him! (Brown is the name of this brown bear.)

Did you see that Brown inclines his head and speech bubble with a question mark? Isn't this cute?

I used `<div>`s for all of the parts besides eyes. His eyes are created with an unordered list with two empty list items. 

## How to create a speech bubble
I used a `<div>` and pseudo selectors, `:before` and `:after` to create this speech bubble.
