This is a first app that I created using Redux. It's a would you rather app that users can answer and create new polls, see results and see all users' data.

### What I worked on
- Design the components structure.
- Create PrivateRoute component to route user to login page if the user isn't authorized.
- Manage user and questions data.
- Manage app data to create actions, reducers and middleware.
- Add responsive design.
