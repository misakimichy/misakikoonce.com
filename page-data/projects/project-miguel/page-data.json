I created this project to have better understanding for animation, SVG and to test how much I can create and design with pure CSS.</p>\n<h3>How to create spines</h3>\n<p>I used <strong>font-awesome</strong> for spines. I applied two certificate icons for head and body using <code>&#x3C;i></code> tag.</p>\n<h3>How to create face</h3>\n<p>Those ears, eyes and nose are empty DOM element and set the size and color in CSS. I created paired items, ears and eyes, using unordered list so that it's going to easy to style them together. </br>\nI used SVG to create a cute little smile.</p>\n<h3>How to create the moving feet</h3>\n<p>Those tootsies are all <code>&#x3C;div></code>s. The reason I didn't use list is that I could add different animation for each of them and I could enjoy the different moves.</p>\n<p>The original positions are set used <code>transform: rotate(Xdeg);</code>. Then I added animation for 5000 millisecond. Within the 5 second, those little feet moves back and forth because I change the <code>transform: rotate(Xdeg)</code> in every 20% of the time.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 17, 2018","path":"/projects/project-miguel","title":"Project Miguel","projectUrl":"https://misakimichy.github.io/project-miguel/","stackTags":["HTML","CSS"],"techTags":["HTML","CSS","CSS animation"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"/Users/misakimichy/src/misakikoonce.com/src/pages/projects.js"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2330788219"]}
