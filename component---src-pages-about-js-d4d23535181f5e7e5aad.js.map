I self-taught HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and React. After I spent a year\n        self-teaching programming, I joined a full-time coding bootcamp to gain experience working\n        with a team. I pair-programmed a few applications a day, worked on a solo project every\n        Friday, and created two applications with 4 peers with vanilla JavaScript, React, and C#.\n        While I was on the bootcamp, I found a cool tech startup called At BrainSquall, I learned a\n        lot there and fell in love with the vibe of startup.
