I self-taught HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and React. After I spent a year self-teaching programming, I joined a full-time coding bootcamp to gain experience working with a team. I pair-programmed a few applications a day, worked on a solo project every Friday, and created two applications with 4 peers with vanilla JavaScript, React, and C#. While I was on the cootcamp, I found a cool tech startup called <a href=\"https://www.brainsquall.co/\">BrainSquall</a>, and I joined their engineering team as a Software Engineer intern.</p>\n\n      <h3>What am I currently learning?</h3>\n      <p>GarphQL and UI design.</p>\n\n      <h3>This is me! - Besides tech</h3>\n      <p>😽I like spending time with my twin kittens, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pnwbubbies/\">Coop and Tot</a>.</p>\n      <p>👩🏻‍🍳I'm a foodie.
